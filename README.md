# Free TO-DO
Welcome to free todo github page.

## Goal
The goal of this project is just to improve my skills.<br>
Also make android best practice samples.

## Warning
This project is developing now.

## Environment
This android application made with 
[Dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger), 
[ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife),
[Guava](https://github.com/google/guava),
[Guava EventBus](https://github.com/google/guava),
[Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric)
and etc.
<br>

## Motivation
I searched about android architecture and found [google/android-architecture](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture). <br>
Then, I followed these samples few days. But I found some strange parts. Of course this parts is not fatal errors. But this project and samples must be best practice for android.<br>
Finally, I stopped following this samples. And started create another version of my best practice.
